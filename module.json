  "description": "The power level of skill feats can vary quite a lot. Some like Battle Medicine are incredibly good and are strongly considered by many players. Others are mostly there for flavour, doing very little mechanically. I found that many of my players don't enjoy skill feats because it is a lot of decision making for low impact. This is my attempt to make skill feats more enjoyable.\n\nImportantly I did not want to take anything away from skill feats. If there is a strange or niche thing a skill feat does that should still be available to you. So nothing has been taken away or nerfed, I have only added.\n\nIn total 161 feats have been changed.",
